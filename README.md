# GT-pool - Golden Ticket Ingot Pool Repository

This repository stores ingot pools from the Golden Ticket app to demonstrate the increased odds of winning using optimized number selection over random selection (quickpick).

## Purpose

The Golden Ticket app uses sophisticated algorithms to optimize lottery number selection. This repository serves as a transparent, verifiable record of ingot pools generated by the app, allowing users to:

1. **Verify Authenticity** - Checksums are published before lottery draws to prove pools were created beforehand
2. **Compare Results** - Track performance against random selection methods
3. **Demonstrate Effectiveness** - Show the statistical advantage of strategic number selection

## What is an Ingot Pool?

An ingot pool is a curated set of lottery number combinations generated using the Golden Ticket app's optimization algorithm. Unlike random quickpicks, these numbers are strategically selected to:

- Maximize coverage of the number space
- Optimize based on historical frequency patterns
- Distribute numbers strategically across entries
- Increase probability of matching winning combinations

## Increased Odds vs Random Selection

### Random Selection (Quickpick)
- Numbers are chosen purely at random
- No optimization or strategic distribution
- Equal probability for all number combinations
- Potential for duplicate or inefficient coverage

### Golden Ticket Ingot Pool
- Numbers selected using optimization algorithms
- Strategic distribution across entries
- Maximizes coverage of likely winning combinations
- Reduces redundancy and increases efficiency
- Historical pattern analysis incorporated

**Result**: The ingot pool approach provides statistically better coverage and higher probability of matching winning numbers compared to random selection.

## Repository Contents

### Pool Files
- `ingot_pool.json` - The ingot pool data containing optimized number combinations (JSON format)
- `YYYY-MM-DD_combinations.txt` - Text file with indexed combinations from the pool
- `YYYY-MM-DD_results.txt` - Lottery draw results and prize breakdown (added after draw)

### Verification Files
- `pool_checksum.txt` - SHA-256 checksum published before the draw for verification
- `pool_checksum_verify.txt` - Standard format checksum file for automated verification
- `generate_checksum.sh` - Script to generate checksums
- `verify_checksum.sh` - Script to verify pool integrity

## Verification Process

### Before the Draw

The checksum is generated and published to this repository:

```bash
./generate_checksum.sh
```

This creates `pool_checksum.txt` with the SHA-256 hash of the ingot pool.

### After the Draw

Anyone can verify the pool wasn't modified after the checksum was published:

```bash
./verify_checksum.sh
```

Or manually verify:

```bash
sha256sum ingot_pool.json
# Compare with checksum in pool_checksum.txt
```

## Pool Structure

### JSON Format (ingot_pool.json)

The ingot pool is stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "pool_id": "Unique identifier",
  "created_date": "Creation date",
  "description": "Pool description",
  "methodology": "Selection methodology",
  "entries": [
    {
      "entry_id": 1,
      "numbers": [array of selected numbers],
      "bonus": bonus_number
    }
  ],
  "coverage_analysis": {
    "unique_numbers_covered": count,
    "number_frequency_optimized": boolean,
    "strategic_distribution": "description"
  }
}
```

### Combinations File Format (YYYY-MM-DD_combinations.txt)

The combinations file lists all pool entries in a simple text format:

```
[0] 1 2 3 4 5 6
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 7
[2] 1 2 3 4 5 8
...
```

Each line shows the combination index and the numbers for that entry.

### Results File Format (YYYY-MM-DD_results.txt)

After the lottery draw, results are documented including:
- Draw date and winning numbers
- Bonus number
- Total combinations checked
- SHA-256 checksum of the combinations file
- Prize breakdown (matches at each level)
- Jackpot winning combination ID (if applicable)
- Link to public posting for verification

## Transparency and Trust

By publishing the checksum before the draw, we ensure:

1. **No Post-Draw Manipulation** - The pool cannot be changed after results are known
2. **Verifiable Authenticity** - Anyone can verify the pool's integrity
3. **Transparent Methodology** - The approach is documented and reproducible
4. **Statistical Validation** - Results can be compared against random selection
